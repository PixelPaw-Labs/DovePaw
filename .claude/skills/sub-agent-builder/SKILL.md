## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional agent name and/or purpose. Parse any name/purpose hints before asking questions.

## System Requirements

- DovePaw must be installed (`~/.dovepaw/` must exist)
- Read `~/.dovepaw/settings.json` to discover configured repositories before Round 2 questions

---

## Execution

### Phase 1 — Requirements Gathering

**Round 1** — parse `$ARGUMENTS` first, then ask 3 questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call:

1. **Purpose** — "What should this agent do?" — free text via Other
2. **Plugin repo** — "Which plugin repo will this agent eventually live in?" — run `ls ~/.dovepaw/plugins/` and offer each dir basename as an option, plus "None / decide later"
3. **Agent type** — "Which pattern fits this agent?" — present 3 options with code previews:
   - **Simple** — single Claude spawn with a prompt (most agents)
   - **Skill-based** — dynamically builds a temporary skill, runs it, cleans up (for complex context assembly)
   - **Stateful** — lock + state dir + orchestration (for scheduled agents requiring mutual exclusion)

**Round 2** — read `~/.dovepaw/settings.json`, extract `repositories` array (each has `id`, `path`), then ask 4 questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call:

1. **Schedule** — "Enable scheduled runs?" — options:
   - On-demand only (Recommended) — triggered manually from chatbot
   - Interval — runs every N seconds
   - Calendar — runs at a fixed time daily/weekly

2. **Repositories** — "Which repositories should this agent access?" — multi-select; show basename of each `path`; include "None" option

3. **Env vars** — "Which environment variables does this agent need?" — infer from purpose (Jira → `JIRA_API_KEY`, GitHub → `GITHUB_TOKEN`, Slack → `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, email → `GMAIL_TOKEN`, Linear → `LINEAR_API_KEY`); multi-select; include "None" option

4. **Icon** — "Which icon suits this agent best?" — pick 4 from the catalog in `references/agent-registration.md` based on purpose (analytics/reasoning → `Brain`, automation → `Zap`, alerts/incidents → `BellRing`, docs → `FileText`, code → `GitMerge`)

---

### Phase 2 — Design file structure, then generate source files

Read the appropriate template from `references/`:

| Type        | Template file                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Simple      | `references/template-simple.md`           |
| Skill-based | `references/template-skill-based.md`      |
| Stateful    | `references/template-complex-stateful.md` |

The template is a **starting point**, not a rigid layout. Before writing any files, analyse the agent's requirements and decide the file structure:

**Apply SOLID principles to derive the file structure:**

- **S — Single Responsibility:** `main.ts` owns only process lifecycle, config constants, and top-level flow. Each module owns exactly one concern. If a file is doing two things, split it.
- **O — Open/Closed:** Put variable logic (prompts, discovery queries, state format) in modules that can be extended without touching `main.ts`.
- **D — Dependency Inversion:** Infrastructure (log, dirs, instruction) flows **down as function params** into modules — modules never read from `process.env` directly.

Practical rules:

1. Identify each distinct logical concern (prompt building, data discovery, state management, skill lifecycle, parallel orchestration). For each:
   - **Simple** (a few lines, no branching) → keep inline in `main.ts`
   - **Substantial** (own logic, data types, or >~30 lines) → extract to a named module
2. Name modules after **what they do**: `skill-builder.ts`, `state.ts`, `discover.ts`, `prompts.ts`, `run.ts`
3. Do not over-split — three concerns in one file beats three files doing one line each.

Substitute all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values in every file before writing.

**Instruction passing:**

The A2A executor spawns the agent as `tsx main.ts "<instruction>"`. The user's message arrives as `process.argv[2]`. Every agent template must read it at the top:

```typescript
const INSTRUCTION = process.argv[2] || "";
```

Then pass it through to Claude — either appended to the prompt string (`Instruction: ${INSTRUCTION}`) or as part of the skill invocation (`/${skillName}\n\n${INSTRUCTION}`). Never silently discard it; it is the user's intent for that specific run.

**Spawning rules (use judgment):**

- Always run Claude in `AGENT_WORKSPACE` — never change cwd to `REPOS[0]`. `REPOS` is a list; the agent may need all of them.
- If repos selected and agent is read-only: pass all repos as `--add-dir` flags: `REPOS.flatMap(r => ["--add-dir", r])`
- If repos selected and agent writes to one specific repo: use that repo as cwd with `-w <branch>` (worktree); add remaining repos with `--add-dir`
- If agent has sequential steps that share context: chain with `--session-id` / `--resume`
- Single-step agents: plain `-p` prompt, no worktree, no session chaining

---

### Phase 3 — Create agent.json

Create `~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/agent.json` using the template in `references/agent-registration.md`.

Fill in all fields:

- `name` — kebab-case
- `alias` — 2–3 char shorthand (make it unique)
- `displayName` — human-readable title
- `description` — MCP tool description Dove uses to route requests
- `personality` — 1–3 sentence character paragraph; write in second person ("You are…"); replaces the generic "You are one of Dove's mice…" opening in the sub-agent system prompt
- `schedulingEnabled` — `true` only if interval/calendar
- `schedule` — include only when schedulingEnabled; use `"interval"` or `"calendar"` type
- `repos` — UUIDs from settings.json matching selected repo paths
- `envVars` — `[{ "id": "<uuid>", "key": "VAR", "value": "", "isSecret": true }]` for each required var — `id` is required by the schema (use `crypto.randomUUID()` pattern: generate a fresh UUID for each entry)
- `iconName` / `iconBg` / `iconColor` — from icon choice (see color palettes in `references/agent-registration.md`)
- `doveCard` — write a concise title + description + starter prompt
- `suggestions` — 3 realistic starter prompts based on agent purpose

Do NOT set `pluginPath` — that is added at publish time.

After writing `agent.json`, bootstrap the agent's `node_modules` so `@dovepaw/agent-sdk` resolves at runtime:

```bash
python3 -c "
import os
base = os.path.expanduser('~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>')
pkg_dir = os.path.join(base, 'node_modules', '@dovepaw')
os.makedirs(pkg_dir, exist_ok=True)
sdk_target = os.path.expanduser('~/.dovepaw/sdk')
link = os.path.join(pkg_dir, 'agent-sdk')
if not os.path.exists(link):
    os.symlink(sdk_target, link)
"
```

---

### Phase 4 — Associated Skill

Ask 2 questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call:

1. **Create a skill?** — "Should this agent have an associated skill?" — options:
   - Yes — create a `SKILL.md` alongside the agent (Recommended for agents with multi-step Claude prompts)
   - No — embed the logic in `main.ts` directly (for pure TypeScript orchestrators or trivial 3-line prompts)
   - Skip for now — add later

2. **Suggested skill name** — pre-fill with the agent name (kebab-case); ask the user to confirm or override. Note that skill name is also the `/skill-name` command users invoke directly.

If the user selects **No** or **Skip**, end Phase 4 here.

If the user selects **Yes**, proceed to create the skill:

#### Skill file location

When building a tmp agent, skill files live in a `skill/` subdirectory — separate from the agent source files:

```
~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/               ← agent source (main.ts, agent.json, run.ts, etc.)
~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/skill/         ← skill files (SKILL.md, references/, scripts/, etc.)
~/.claude/skills/<name>/             ← symlink pointing to ~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/skill/
```

Create the `skill/` dir and symlink with Python (bypasses shell permission checks):

```bash
python3 -c "
import os
skill_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/skill')
os.makedirs(skill_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.symlink(skill_dir, os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/skills/<name>'))
"
```

Write `SKILL.md` (and any `references/`, `scripts/` subdirs) inside `~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/skill/`.

When publishing to a plugin repo:

```
skills/<name>/SKILL.md               ← inside plugin repo
```

Read `references/skill-authoring.md` for the SKILL.md schema, argument patterns, output contracts, subdirectory conventions, and hooks.

Read `references/skill-best-practices.md` before writing the SKILL.md body — apply every principle to the content you generate.

#### Agent → skill invocation

In `main.ts` (or `prompts.ts`), the agent embeds the skill call in the prompt string it passes to `spawnClaude`:

```typescript
// Positional args — simple single-value invocation
const prompt = `Skill("/zendesk-triager ${INSTRUCTION}")`;

// key="value" pairs — multi-param invocation
const skillArgs = `package="${name}" ecosystem="${ecosystem}" fix="${fix}" manifest="${manifest}"`;
const prompt = lines.join("\n");
// lines includes: `Skill("/security-patcher ${skillArgs}")`

// JSON args — multi-package batch
const skillArgs = JSON.stringify({ manifest, ecosystem, ticket, packages });
// lines includes: `Skill("/security-patcher ${skillArgs}")`
```

The skill receives these via `$ARGUMENTS` — parse them at the top of the SKILL.md.

#### Output contract

Skills that are called by agents in a loop (fix → test → retry) must emit a structured result as the **last line** of their response so the agent can parse it:

```
{"status": "patched"|"partial"|"failed", "summary": "...", "approach": "..."}
```

Skills called for their side effects only (write file, open PR) need no structured output — plain text completion is fine.

#### Plugin manifest

When publishing to a plugin repo, add the skill name to `dovepaw-plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": ["my-agent"],
  "skills": ["my-agent"]
}
```

Skills and agents are listed independently — a skill can exist without a same-named agent, and vice versa.

---

### Phase 5 — Integration Check

Read each created file back and verify against this checklist. Fix any issue found, then re-check until every item passes:

- **main.ts** — all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values substituted; spawning pattern matches the chosen Option A/B/C; `INSTRUCTION` is passed through to Claude; no dead branches; `emitProgress` called at meaningful steps; subprocess env is correct (no `CLAUDECODE`, clean PATH)
- **agent.json** — all required fields present; `pluginPath` is NOT set; every entry in `envVars` has an `id` UUID (missing `id` causes Zod to silently drop the agent from the Kiln group)
- **SKILL.md** (if created) — frontmatter is valid for Claude Code; argument pattern is documented; output contract is defined

End with a confidence score JSON on its own line:

```json
{"confidence": <0-100>, "issues": ["<any remaining issue>"]}
```

The Stop hook requires `confidence >= 90` to proceed. Emit this only after all fixes are complete — it must reflect the post-fix state.

Tell the user: "Your agent is ready. **Refresh the page** to see it appear under the **Kiln** group in the sidebar (Sparkles icon). No server restart needed."

---

### Phase 6 — Publish to Plugin Repo

Ask 2 questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call:

1. "Move agent from Kiln to plugin repo and push?" — options:
   - Yes, move and push now (Recommended)
   - Move locally only, push later
   - Keep in Kiln for now

2. "Install and restart DovePaw servers?" — options:
   - Yes — run `npm run install` + restart servers (Recommended)
   - No, I'll handle it later

**If publishing:**

1. Determine plugin repo path from user's Round 1 answer (or ask again if "None" was chosen)
2. Create `agents/<name>/` in the plugin repo dir
3. Copy `~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/main.ts` → `agents/<name>/main.ts`
4. Copy `~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/agent.json` → `agents/<name>/agent.json`, add `"pluginPath": "<abs-plugin-repo-path>"`
5. Read `dovepaw-plugin.json` in the plugin repo, add `"<name>"` to the `agents` array, write back
6. `git add agents/<name>/ dovepaw-plugin.json && git commit -m "feat: add <name> agent" && git push` (in plugin repo dir)
7. Remove `~/.dovepaw/tmp/<name>/` so agent exits the Kiln group

**If installing:** run `npm run install` in the DovePaw project root (confirm with user before running).

Always remind: restart `npm run chatbot:servers` to register the new A2A server.
